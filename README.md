# Puzzle Me This

This project is being created in the hope that it will be a benefit to individuals on the autism spectrum as well as their caregivers. Keeping track of behavioral trends, sleep patterns, diet, etc can be a daunting task for caregivers. Our aim is to create an open-source app that will make it simple to track this type of information and will also allow meaningful analysis of the data.

## Phase 1 - Data input

For this first phase we want to keep it simple. Just a simple app that runs on an Android device and allows data entry.
* All data will be stored on the device for this first phase
* We will start with entry of behaviors and get that working well before moving on to health, diet, and sleep

## Phase 2 - Multi-user

For phase 2 we want to add multi-user support. We all know that raising someone on the spectrum "takes a village" so we want to allow caregivers in all roles the ability to enter data. The idea being that the more data we can collect, the more helpful the analysis will be.
Roles we have thought of so far:
* Self (if the individual on the spectrum is an adolescent or older then let's let them record their moods and feelings.)
* Parent
* Teacher
* Doctor
* Therapist
* After-school care or babysitter

This will require a server-side component to allow synchronization of data between multiple users. We need to explore if we can get hosting donated or somehow raise the funding for it.

## Phase 3 - Data analysis

For phase 3 we want to focus on building quality reports that provide meaningful feedback to caregivers.

## Phase 4 and beyond

* Add ios and web apps 
* Send messages to other caregivers
* Reward system that tracks points that allow individual to earn a reward
* Allow location tracking of individual
* Watch module (Android Wear / Apple Watch)
